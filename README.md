A soccer game defying the Newton's laws of motion.
Newton's first law plays a role in soccer. The soccer ball, when kicked, keeps going forward until friction, a person, or another object like a wall stops it. When a soccer ball is resting non moving on the ground, it will stay like that until someone kicks it or another force acts upon it.
The second law affects the speed of the ball and the player. The more weight the ball has, the slower it goes. The more weight the player has, the slower he can run. Heavier people kick farther than lighter people. Lighter people can run faster than heavier people.
When you kick a soccer ball, it goes forward. That is the action. The reaction is that the goalie catches the ball in his hands, which stops the ball from moving. This is how the third law affects the soccer ball.
